I am a second(final) year Masterâ€™s Student in Electrical Engineering at the [George Washington University (GWU)](https://www.gwu.edu/) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from [Baku Higher Oil School (BHOS)](https://bhos.edu.az/) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿, and also spent a semester at [AlcalÃ¡ University](https://www.uah.es/en/) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

I am currently working on my [thesis](/thesis.pdf), where we try to design and analyze an FPGA-based controller for GAN-based three phase inverters. This project is carried out under the supervision of [XXX]().

Previously, I worked on designing level control system using Emerson control valves on a testbed rig for my [bachelor's thesis](/bs-thesis.pdf). I also worked on
building assistive system for visually impaired people using technologies such as _Arduino, Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV._

<!-- I love solving complex challenges in *Robotics, Control Systems, and Power Systems*, particularly through the application of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IoT to enhance innovation and efficiency. -->

Regarding industry experience, I currently work as a _Project Engineer I_ at [Honeywell](https://honeywell.com) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. Previously, I interned as an _Instrumentation and Control Engineer_ at [Emerson](https://emerson.com) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and [Socar Polymer](https://www.socarpolymer.az/) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿. Please, check my [resume](/resume.pdf) for the details.

> _I am actively looking for PhD positions in Electrical Engineering._

I love painting ðŸŽ¨ and photography ðŸ“¸, you can see some of my works [here](https://www.instagram.com/mujgan.huseynli/).

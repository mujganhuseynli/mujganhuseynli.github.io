I am a final-year Masterâ€™s Student in Electrical Engineering at [George Washington University (GWU)](https://www.gwu.edu/) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from [Baku Higher Oil School (BHOS)](https://bhos.edu.az) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿, and I also spent a semester at [AlcalÃ¡ University](https://www.uah.es/en/) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

I love solving complex challenges in *Robotics, Control Systems, and Power Systems*, particularly through the application of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IoT to enhance innovation and efficiency.

Currently, I work as a Project Engineer I at [Honeywell](https://honeywell.com) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, where I explore new paradigms and apply advanced computational techniques to enhance the capabilities of smart and autonomous systems.

Previously, I interned as an Instrumentation and Control Engineer at [Emerson](https://emerson.com) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and [Socar Polymer](https://www.socarpolymer.az/) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿, where I developed and implemented control strategies for industrial processes.

***I am actively seeking to advance my career by pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering and am eager to collaborate with leading scholars in these vibrant fields.***

  title={Report on Hydrogen Energy Storage},
  author={Mujgan Huseynli},
  abstract={Hydrogen energy storage has garnered significant attention as
a crucial component of sustainable energy systems, particularly for integrating renewable energy sources and
addressing grid stability challenges. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of hydrogen energy storage,
covering key aspects from production to utilization. Beginning
with an introduction to the importance of energy storage in the
context of renewable energy integration, the paper discusses
various methods of hydrogen storage such as compressed gas
storage, cryogenic storage, and material-based storage,
highlighting their respective advantages and limitations.
Furthermore, the concept of power-to-power storage, which
involves converting electrical energy into hydrogen through
electrolysis and reconverting it back to electricity using fuel
cells or combustion engines, is explored in detail. The paper
also addresses current challenges facing hydrogen energy
storage, including technological constraints, infrastructure
limitations, and cost considerations, and proposes potential
solutions to overcome these challenges. Finally, future
directions and research opportunities in hydrogen energy
storage are discussed, emphasizing the role of innovation and
collaboration in advancing this critical technology for a
sustainable energy future.},

  title={Design of Level Control Loop by Control Valve at Emerson Test Rig},
  author={Mujgan Huseynli},
  abstract={Level control loops are widespread and necessary in the industry to monitor and control the process properly, and to ensure the safety and efficiency of the plant. If the level of the substance is not properly measured or maintained correctly, it can result in production loss, the damage to the equipment and process. Therefore, control loops will always carry out the following three actions in order to avoid undesirable situations: measurement, comparison, and modification.
In order to maintain the stability of the system and perform the mentioned tasks, level control loop technologies of BHOS test rig are selected according to the system requirements. This system comprises the needed components for automated control: the sensing device, the disturbance source, the controller, and the final control element (FCE). Firstly, the level transmitter measures tank level and sends a signal to the related level controller. Guided-Wave-Radar level/interface transmitter is selected as it has a long measuring range and less sensitivity to the disturbances. Then, the controller compares measured value with the desired value and transmits a control action to FCE. The best-suited algorithm for controlling the system is Proportional-Integral - PI control. If required, the controller can be tuned using Trial-and-Error approach. Lastly, the valve receives a control action and opens to allow some liquid to exit the tank. The globe valve is selected as it is most suitable for full-range flow control situations. In addition, the inlet pump speed can be altered and disturbance to the system can be created by altering the frequency of the Variable-Frequency-Drive.
As a result of technology review and design of the loop for the test rig, technical documentation used at various phases of the project will be created for the system. As a contribution to the future curriculum, lab work instructions will also be prepared based on the project.
